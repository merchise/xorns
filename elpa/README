"Xorns" provides routines and variables to use Emacs in a better way,
according to "Merchise Group" best practices and rules.

The name "xorns" comes from "horns" as a metaphor in the sense that "Emacs" is
the head of the "GNU" and our framework would be "horns" of that head.  The
*X* instead the *H* is due to the name of all Merchise projects start with
that letter looking for words in Nahuatl or sometimes in English replacing *H*
by *X*.

To me, it takes several years since I talked face to face to :name:`Stallman`
(RMS) and -among other themes- Emacs was in the plate.  I started programming
when I was very young by the time :name:`RMS` was migrating ideologically to
*free software movement*.  In that moment it was very far the first time the
names of that movement and :name:`RMS` comes to me, but always I defended the
same principles until today.  I discovered that the best way to learn a lot of
programming will be collaborating the most freely possible.  I founded in
\ :name:`Central University of Las Villa` (at :name:`Santa Clara`, Cuba) the
Group of Programmers named :name:`Merchise`, *the only fault will be not to
share all learned knowledge*.

I while ago I started using Emacs, today I think that nobody can really
understand what is its strength: for a hacker (in the meaning of *real
programmer*) there is no option, all we need is Emacs nicely configured.

Enjoy Emacs and this package as our first and small gift!



Installation
============

To install this package from `xorns-<version>.tar` follow standard
Emacs package installation.

Above if not the best way, if you have the *GIT repository*, then execute from
the shell command line::

    $ emacs --load=install.el --batch --debug

After the package is fully installed (with its all dependencies), just
configure one of the standard initialization files (`~/.emacs` or
`~/.emacs.d/init.el`)\ [#inif]_ with the following body::

    (package-initialize)
    (require 'xorns)

If you want to configure extra features, include also::

    (require 'xorns-extra)

The variable `xorns-config-level` can be set in order to `xorns` configure
several settings in the manner Merchise members prefers:

- `'basic` or `0`:  Only basic configurations are performed.

- `'general` or `1`: More general configurations are set.

- `'maximum` or any other true value: All Merchise specific configurations are
  executed.

If this variable is not configured or nil, no specific configuration are
executed (see `Specific Merchise Settings`_ for more info).

A final initialization file could be::

    ;; Activate ELPA packages.
    (package-initialize)

    (let ((xorns-config-level 'maximum))
      ;; Start the server and initialize all common Merchise settings.
      (require 'xorns)
      ;; Require extra features
      (require 'xorns-extra))


Auxiliary Commands
------------------

In `Xorns ELPA package` there is a folder named `bin` with several shell
executable files in order to use them to open `emacsclient` in any context,
inside or outside Emacs, when server is running or not:

- emc

- emacs-c

- emacs-nw


Documentation
=============

Most documentation can be found in each module header commentaries.  But
we think that if you are installing this package, you are an advanced
Emacs user and probably (but not necessary) a nice programmer.  Then
will be enough to review our source code and hit sometimes `C-h f` or
`C-h v` to see Emacs documentation for `xorns` functions and variables.


Specific Merchise Settings
--------------------------

- Function `xorns-manage-custom-file` is executed in the `'basic` level.

- Key-binding `C-x C-b` is configured for launch `ibuffer` in `'basic` level.

- Configure some preferred groups for `ibuffer` in `'general` level.

- Key-binding `C-c s` is configured for launch `xorns-force-scratch` in
  `'basic` level.

- Set `(xorns-prefered-default-directory)` as initial directory for
  `*scratch*` buffer in `'general` level.

- If `dired-single` is installed, configure recommended key-bindings in
  `'basic` level (See `xorns-setup-dired-single` function).

- Configure three additional package repositories ("http://tromey.com/elpa/",
  "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/" and
  "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/") in `'general` level.

- Configure `global-flycheck-mode` if feature `flycheck` is installed in
  `'basic` level.

- Set `yas-global-mode` if feature `yasnippet` is installed in `'basic` level.

- Setup `jedi` for Python if installed in `'basic` level.  Also define
  key-binding `C-c h` for run function `jedi:show-doc`.

- Setup `inferior-python-mode` in `'general` level.

- If `magit` is installed, configure key binding `C-x g` and spell checking in
  related modes for `'basic` level.

- Re-configure in `'maximum` level, key-binding `C-x C-b` to use
  `xorns-helm-buffers-list` that uses `helm` to open buffer list if installed
  and preferred.  Feature `helm` is required with `xorns-extra`.

- Configure hook to load `gnus` configuration file in `'maximum` level.


TODO List
=========


Install
-------

- Create links, copy, or make available in PATH all shell commands in `bin`
  directory.


`dired-single`
--------------

- The buffer must be re-used only when there is no another window showing the
  same directory.

- When exit one level up (like `cd ..`) position the cursor over the last
  folder.

- When multiple directories are going to be deleted, ask just once for *"Delete
  * [n files] (y or n)"* and *"Recursively delete <FOLDER NAME> (y or n)"*.


Shell Terminals
---------------

- Execute all :name:`Emacs Lisp` commands in order to have `eshell` like
  `bash` in normal terminals.  For example, use `setenv`.

  When updating the environment variable `PATH`, also set the Emacs Lips
  `exec-path`.  See in Emacs manual "36 Running Shell Commands from Emacs".

- `Auxiliary commands`_ (in `bin` directory) must work in `sudo` modes.



Buffers
-------

- Create function `xorns-clean-buffer-list`.


Deft
----
Use the following code to obtain better Deft presentation::

  (defun deft-chomp (str)
    "Trim leading and trailing whitespace from STR."
    (let ((aux (replace-regexp-in-string
		 "\\(^[[:space:]\n]*\\|[[:space:]\n]*$\\)" "" str)))
	(replace-regexp-in-string
	  "[-~#=* ]\\{3,\\}" " " aux)))


.. Footnotes

.. [#inif] We encourage `~/.emacs.d/init.el`.

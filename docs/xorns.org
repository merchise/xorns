* Introduction

Xorns is our way of experiencing Emacs -- it automates the configuration of
the Emacs packages commonly used by Merchise members with the intention of
creating a coherent environment, focused on ergonomics, to perform our work
that includes Computer Programming and Documentation Management.

Xorns is currently experimental, contributions are very welcome.

The name "xorns" comes from the metaphor about that "Emacs" is the "GNU's
head" and our framework would be "horns" ;).  The "X" instead the "H" is due
to most Merchise project names start with that letter looking for words in
Nahuatl or sometimes in English replacing "H" by "X".

Xorns configures most packages using ~use-package~ and related tools.  Generic
most important are ~deft~, ~dired~, and ~magit~.

Enjoy Emacs and this package as our first and small gift!

* Installation
** _ :ignore:

Xorns can be installed using Emacs' Package Manager or manually from
its development repository.

** Installing from ELPA

ELPA is "GNU Emacs Lisp Package Archive".

This is a pending task, Xorns is not yet in any ELPA repository, but it will
be available eventually ASAP.  If you haven't used Emacs' Package Manager
before, then it's a good time you familiarize yourself with it by reading the
documentation in the Emacs Info Page.

We already started to use "use-package" and we will automate all
package dependencies management in the future using it.

You can familiarize with Emacs' package manager by reading the documentation
in the Emacs manual, see [[info:emacs#Packages]].  Then add the archives to
~package-archives~:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (package-initialize)

  (setq package-archives
    '(("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
      ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")
      ("org" . "https://orgmode.org/elpa/")))
#+END_SRC

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the
local package list using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-refresh-contents RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Once "xorns" has been deployed in any ELPA repository, and you have
done that above, you can install it using:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  M-x package-install RET xorns RET
#+END_EXAMPLE

Now see [[*Post-Installation Tasks][*Post-Installation Tasks]].

** Installing from the GIT repository

There are two ways:

*** Using Xorns as an autonomous repository

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  $ cd
  $ mv .emacs.d .emacs.d.bak
  $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/merchise/xorns.git .emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Then start Emacs.  Wait for a while at the first startup to install all
dependency packages.  Enjoy!

** Installing Xorns locally as an ELPA package

Xorns depends on many packages (see "default.mk" variable "DEPENDENCIES")
which are available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable.  Install them using ~M-x
package-install RET <package> RET~.  Of course you may also install them
manually from their repository.

Then clone the Xorns repository to your softlib dir:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  $ cd <your/softlib/dir>
  $ git clone https://github.com/merchise/xorns.git
  $ cd xorns
  $ make local-install
#+END_SRC

Any dependency you haven't installed from ELPA or at
~/path/to/emacs/softlib/<package>~, then you have to tell ~make~
where to find them.  To do so create the file ~/path/to/xorns/config.mk~
with the following content before running ~make~:

#+BEGIN_SRC makefile
  LOAD_PATH  = -L /path/to/xorns/horns
  LOAD_PATH += -L /path/to/<dependency-1>
  ...
  LOAD_PATH += -L /path/to/<dependency-n>
#+END_SRC

We have a pre-configured  ~init.el~, you can use it or adapt a previous one to
require Xorns

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'xorns)
#+END_SRC

* Getting Started

This short tutorial describes the most essential features that most
Merchisians use on a daily basis.  It only scratches the surface but
should be enough to get you started.

To be continued ...

* Initialization

** Running Emacs

If Emacs is executed with the option ~--debug-init~ (see ~init-file-debug~
variable) ~custom-file~ it is loaded activating the errors.  In addition,
some debug messages are printed during the initialization process.

* Local User Configuration

In Xorns, local user configuration file (see =custom-file= Emacs variable)
will be stored in the standard directory for user-specific configurations
(XDG_CONFIG_HOME), defaults to =~/.config/xorns=.  If that folder does not
exist on your system, the user home is used =~/.xorns=.

The first version of this file is copied from =horns/templates/custom.el=.

Because there are former releases of Xorns using old style =custom-file=, the
first time the new style file is create, old variables are imported from
=~/.emacs.d/custom-${USER}.el= (or =~/.emacs.d/custom.el=).

New style user configuration file use three functions:

- =>>=settings/init=: Configuration code for user-settings.

  This function is called at the very beginning of the startup process.  It
  should only modify setting-variables (those prefixed with '>>=|') when their
  default values are not suitable for your configuration.  See for example
  =>>=|default-font= to configure your system font (=custom-set-faces= is
  overwritten in this version of Xorns).

- =>>=building-blocks/configuration=: Configuration code for building-blocks
  customization.

  This function should only modify variables to customize how building-blocks
  are loaded (those prefixed with '>>=+') when their default values are not
  suitable for your configuration.

- =>>=user-code=: User-code executed after initialization process.

* Configure Emacs as a Window Manager

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EXWM

https://github.com/ch11ng/exwm/wiki

** Install

Make sure you have =emacs= and =xorg-xinit= installed.

From within Emacs: M-x package-install exwm RET.

Edit =xinitrc= and add: =exec emacs=

To test it at startup, in the folder =/usr/share/xsessions/= add the file
=emacs.desktop= with the content:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
  [Desktop Entry]
  Name=emacs
  Comment=emacs window manager
  Exec=emacs
  # Icon=
  Type=Application
  X-LightDM-DesktopName=emacs
  DesktopNames=emacs
  Keywords=emacs;wm;windowmanager;window;manager;
#+END_SRC

Then restart =lightdm= con =sudo systemctl restart lightdm= and choose "Emacs"
in the button.

* Issues and Feature Requirements

** Error starting initial frame maximized in Manjaro Linux i3 desktop

Report date: 2019-09-18

When I initialize Emacs in the same workspace that it has automatically
assigned, an unwanted border appears on the right of the screen.  To correct
that issue, I must execute full-screen mode twice.  If it is executed from a
different workspace, this problem does not occur.

@manu advised to use this to improve commit messages.  There is n extension
with Emacs: https://github.com/mmagnus/emacs-grammarly

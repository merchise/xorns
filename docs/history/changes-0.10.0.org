#+TITLE: Changes in release 0.10.0

* Misc

- After an update of the ~tree-sitter~ module an error occurred due to a new
  system dependency (~tree-sitter-rust~).  After installing it the error was
  resolved.
- The Emacs server now runs automatically when in EXWM.
- EXWM mecanisms to resize windows were improved.
- Object Oriented Programming tools were added to the 'tools' module.
- Extended terminals are migrated to a new style:
  - Configured 'vterm' package.
  - Used OOP to encapsulate configuration of terminal emulator types, now you
    can configure to use ~vterm~ or ~ansi-term~ by setting variable
    [[file:~/work/emacs/xorns/horns/xorns-term.el::(defvar
    >>=|term/emulator-class '>>=term/vt][>>=|term/emulator-class]] to any of ~>>=term/vt~ or ~>>=term/ansi~ classes.
  - New key shortcuts defined.
  - Removed old ~xterm~ module.

#+TITLE: Changes in release 0.9.3

* User configuration in a folder

Previously, Xorns used a single file to configure user options and the
standard Emacs customization information.  Starting with this version, a
folder can be used to separate these concepts into two different files.  In
addition to these two basic files, you can add code to be executed each time a
major-mode is entered ("{major-mode}-config.el").

To migrate from a single file to using a folder, split it into two different
files as indicated in the "xorns-config" module documentation.
